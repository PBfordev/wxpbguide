PBâ€™s Guide to Starting with wxWidgets on Microsoft Windows with MinGW and Code::Blocks
===============

This Microsoft Windows specific guide hopes to assist the readers
with decisions regarding which wxWidgets version and configuration
to use and show how to build wxWidgets using MinGW with various 
parameters affecting the resulting build. It also describes in 
detail setting-up a wxWidgets project in popular IDE Code::Blocks.

since GitHub's PDF viewer seems not to support displaying navigable
table of contents or clicking on internal cross-references.
